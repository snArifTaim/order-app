## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- EAS CLI for building (`npm install -g eas-cli`)
- Android Studio (for Android emulator) or physical Android device
- Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
cd OrderApp
npm install
```

### 2. Firebase Configuration

The Firebase configuration is already set up in `src/firebase/firebaseConfig.ts` with the provided credentials.

**Important**: Ensure your Firebase project has:
- **Authentication** enabled (Email/Password provider)
- **Firestore Database** created with the following rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on iOS (Mac only)
npm run ios
```

## 🔄 Order Flow Logic

### 1. Place Order
- User adds items to cart with name and price
- Can adjust quantities or remove items
- Total is calculated automatically
- Order is saved to Firestore upon confirmation
- Order is linked to authenticated user's UID

### 2. Order History
- Fetches all orders for the logged-in user
- Real-time updates via Firestore listener
- Orders sorted by creation date (newest first)
- Empty state shown when no orders exist

### 3. Order Details
- Displays invoice-style summary
- Shows itemized breakdown with quantities and prices
- Includes subtotal and grand total

### 4. Reorder Implementation
- Copies items from previous order
- Navigates to PlaceOrderScreen with pre-populated items
- User can modify items before confirming
- **Does NOT duplicate the Firebase order record**
- Creates a new order only when user confirms

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Implemented

### Bug Fix #1: Reorder Items Handling
**Location**: `PlaceOrderScreen.tsx`  
**Issue**: Reorder items from route params weren't being loaded  
**Fix**: Added useEffect to handle route params on component mount

### Bug Fix #2: Total Calculation
**Location**: `PlaceOrderScreen.tsx` - `calculateTotal()`  
**Issue**: Total wasn't accounting for item quantities  
**Fix**: Changed calculation to `price × quantity` for each item

### Bug Fix #3: FlatList Keys
**Location**: `PlaceOrderScreen.tsx`  
**Issue**: Missing proper key extraction for FlatList items  
**Fix**: Added `keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}`

### Bug Fix #4: Firestore Listener Cleanup
**Location**: `OrderHistoryScreen.tsx`  
**Issue**: Memory leak from unclosed Firestore listener  
**Fix**: Return unsubscribe function in useEffect cleanup

### Bug Fix #5: Date Formatting
**Location**: `OrderHistoryScreen.tsx`  
**Issue**: Firestore timestamps weren't properly converted to Date objects  
**Fix**: Use `.toDate()` method on Firestore timestamps

## 📱 Build & Deployment

### Generate APK (for testing)

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo account
eas login

# Configure EAS Build
eas build:configure

# Build APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

### Generate AAB (for Play Store)

```bash
# Build production AAB
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### Download Build
After build completes, download the APK/AAB from the Expo dashboard or the provided link.

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Development Testing
- Tested on: Expo Go during development
- Features verified: Authentication, order creation, history, reorder

### Real Device Testing
**Instructions**:
1. Build APK using EAS Build preview profile
2. Download APK to Android device
3. Install via USB or download link
4. Test the following:
